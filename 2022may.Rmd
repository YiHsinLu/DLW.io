**Walking along the beach of Lake Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers: Simon (later called peter) and Andrew. They were fishing, throwing their nets into the lake, It was their regular work. Jesus said to them, "Come with me, I'll make a new kind of fisherman out of you. I'll show you how to catch men and women instead of perch and bass." They didn't ask questions, but simply dropping their nets and followed.**

**A short distance down the beach they came upon another pair of brothers, James and John, Zebedee's sons. These two were sitting in the boat with their father, Zebedee, mending their fishnets. Jesus made the same offer to them, and they were just as quick to follow, abandoning boat and father.**

**When Jesus saw his ministry drawing huge crowds, he climbed a hillside. Those who were apprenticed to him, the committed, he sat down and taught his climbing companions. This is what he said:**

**"You're blessed when you're at the end of your rope. With less of you there is more of God and his rules.**
**"You're blessed when you feel you've lost what is most dear to you. Only then can you be embraced by the One most dear to you.**
**"You're blessed when you're content with just who you are--no more, no less. That's the moment you find yourselves proud owners of everything that can't be bought.**
**"You're blessed when you've worked up a good appetite for God. He's food and drink in the best meal you'll ever eat.**
**"You're blessed when you care. At the moment of being 'care-full', you find yourselves cared for.**
**"You're blessed when you get your inside world--your mind and heart--put right. Then you can see God in the outside world.**
**"You're blessed when you can show people how to cooperate instead of compete or fight. That's when you discover who you really are, and your place in God's family.**
**"You're blessed when your commitment to God provokes persecution. The persecution drives you even deeper into God's kingdom.**

**"Not only that--count yourselves blessed every time people put you down or throw you out or speak lies about you to discredit me. What it means is that the truth is too close for comfort and they are uncomfortable. You can be glad when that happens--give a cheer,even!--for though they don't like it, I do! And all heaven applauds. And know that you are in good company. My prophets and witnesses have always gotten into this kind of trouble."**

**"Let me tell you why you are here. You're here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You've lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage.**

**"Here's another way to put it: You're here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We're going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you don't think I'm going to hide you under a bucket, do you? I'm putting you on  a light stand. Now that I've put you on the hilltop, on a light stand--shine! Keep open house, be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you'll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven.**

**"Don't suppose for a minute that I have come to demolish the Scriptures--either God's Law or Prophets. I'm not here to demolish but to complete. I am going to put it all together, pull it all together in a vast panorama. God's Law is more real and lasting than the stars in the sky and the ground at your feet. Long after the stars burn out and earth wears out, God's Law will be alive and working.**

**"Trivialize even the smallest item in God's Law and you will only have trivialized yourself. But take it seriously, show the way for others, and you will find the honor in the kingdom. Unless you do far better than the Pharisees in the matters of right living, you won't know the first thing about entering the kingdom.**

[image from](https://blog.ipleaders.in/murder-under-indian-penal-code-all-you-need-to-know-about-it/)

**"You're familiar with the command to the ancients, 'Do not murder.' I'm telling you that anyone who is so much as angry with a brother or sister is guilty of murder. Carelessly call a brother 'idiot!' and you just might find yourself hauled into court. Thoughtlessly yell 'stupid!' at a sister and you are on a brink of hellfire. The simple moral fact is that words kill.**

**"This is why I want you to conduct yourself in these matters. If you enter your place of worship and, about to make an offering, you suddenly remember a grudge as friend has against you, abandon your offering, leave immediately, go to this friend and make things right. Then and only then, come back and work things out with God.**

**"Or say you're out on the street and an old enemy accosts you. Don't lose a minute. Make the first move; make things right with him. After all, if you leave the first move to him, knowing his track record, you're likely to end up in court, maybe even jail. If that happens, you won't get out without a stiff fine.**

[image from](https://blog.ipleaders.in/adultery-and-divorce/)

**"You know the next commandment pretty well, too: 'Don't go to bed with another's spouse.' But don't think you've preserved your virtue simply by staying out of bed. Your heart can be corrupted by lust even quicker than your body. Those leering looks you think nobody notices--they also corrupt.**

**"Let's not pretend this is easier than it really is. If you want to live a morally pure live, here's what you have to do: You have to blind your right eye the moment you catch it in a lustful leer. You have to choose to live one-eyed or else be dumped on a moral trash pile. And you have to chop off your right hand the moment you notice it raised threateningly. Better a bloody stump than your entire being discarded for good in the dump.**

**"Remember the Scripture that says, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him do it legally, giving her divorce papers and her legal rights'? Too many of you are using that as a cover for selfishness and whim, pretending to be righteous just because you are 'legal'. Please, no more pretending. If you divorce your wife, you're responsible for making her an adulteress (unless she has already made herself that by sexual promiscuity). And if you marry such a divorced adulteress, you're automatically an adulterer yourself. You can't use legal cover to mask a moral failure.**

**"Be especially careful when you are trying to be good so that you don't make a performance out of it. It might be good theater, but the God who made you won't be applauding.**

**"When you do something for someone else, don't call attention to yourself. You've seen them in action, I'm sure--'playactors' I call them--treating prayer meeting and street corner alike as a stage, acting compassionate as long as someone is watching, playing to the crowds. They get applause, true, but that's all they get. When you help someone out, don't think about how it looks. Just do it--quietly and unobtrusively. That is the way your God, who conceived you in love, working behind the scenes, helps you out. **

**"And when you come before God, don't turn that into a theatrical production either. All these people making a regular show out of their prayers, hoping for stardom! Do you think God sits in a box seat?**

**"Here's what I want you to do: Find a quiet, secluded place so you won't be tempted to role-play before God. Just be there as simply and honestly as you can manage. The focus will shift from you to God, and you will begin to sense his grace.**

**"The world is full of so-called prayer warriors who are prayer-ignorant. They're full of formulas and programs and advice, peddling techniques for getting what you want from God. Don't fall for that nonsense. This is your Father you are dealing with, he knows better than you want you need. With a God like this loving you, you can pray very simply. Like this:**

<center>
**$\mathcal{Our}\;\mathcal{Father}\;\mathcal{in}\;\mathcal{heaven},\;\mathcal{Reveal}\;\mathcal{who}\;\mathcal{you}\;\mathcal{are}.$**

**$\mathcal{Set}\;\mathcal{the}\;\mathcal{world}\;\mathcal{right};\;\mathcal{Do}\;\mathcal{what's}\;\mathcal{best}--\;\mathcal{as}\;\mathcal{above},\;\mathcal{so}\;\mathcal{below}.$**

**$\mathcal{Keep}\;\mathcal{us}\;\mathcal{alive}\;\mathcal{with}\;\mathcal{three}\;\mathcal{square}\;\mathcal{meals}.$**

**$\mathcal{Keep}\;\mathcal{us}\;\mathcal{forgiven}\;\mathcal{with}\;\mathcal{you}\;\mathcal{and}\;\mathcal{forgiving}\;\mathcal{others}.$**

**$\mathcal{Keep}\;\mathcal{us}\;\mathcal{safe}\;\mathcal{from}\;\mathcal{ourselves}\;\mathcal{and}\;\mathcal{the}\;\mathcal{Devil}.$**

**$\mathcal{You're}\;\mathcal{in}\;\mathcal{charge}!$**

**$\mathcal{You}\;\mathcal{can}\;\mathcal{do}\;\mathcal{anything}\;\mathcal{you}\;\mathcal{want}!$**

**$\mathcal{You're}\;\mathcal{ablaze}\;\mathcal{in}\;\mathcal{beauty}!$**

**$\mathcal{Yes}.\;\mathcal{Yes}.\;\mathcal{Yes}.\;$**
</center>

**"In prayer there is a connection between what God does and what you do. You can't get forgiveness from God, for instance, without also forgiving others. If you refuse to do your part, you cut yourself off from God's part.**

**"When you practice some appetite-denying discipline to better concentrate on God, don't make a production out of it. It might turn you into a small-time celebrity but it won't make you a saint. If you 'go into training' inwardly, act normal outwardly. Shampoo and comb your hair, brush your teeth, wash your face. God doesn't require attention-getting devices. He won't overlook what you are doing; he'll reward you well.**

**“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.**

**“The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!**

**“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.**

**“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?**

**"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?**

**“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.**

**“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.**

If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.**

**“Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.**

**“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’**

**“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”**

**When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.**
